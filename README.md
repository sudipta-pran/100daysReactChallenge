# 100 days of React Challenge

My progress is documented in my blog http://jinsoft.in/100-days-of-react-challenge/

20/2/19

I created a github repository. The folder name is React-app. It is just testing out the react library on a HTML file. I’m not using node or npm here. I’ve just used react, react-dom and babel libraries as CDN links
